# Places to vist

## Getting started

1.- Clone the project from the repositor to your local (e.g. /home/{User}/Projects) from:

    git clone https://github.com/zziro/portfolio

2.- Once the project is downloaded in your local, go to the Project folder and you will see the index.html file. Right-Click and open with a web browser of your preference.

3.- After that you will see a browser showing a list of places which I traveled last year.
